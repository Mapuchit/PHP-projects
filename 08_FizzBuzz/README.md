# FizzBuzz - PHP loops
> A program that implements two solutions for the FizzBuzz problem using PHP loops and conditionals.

## General info
The program runs in the command line by executing index.php.
It practices PHP loops, conditionals and control flow. 


## Technologies
* PHP v8.0.0
* Git 2.29.2.windows.3


## Features
* Task #1 - The typical FizzBuzz problem:
  * Write code that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive), except for these cases:
    - If a number is a multiple of 3, write "Fizz".
    - If a number is a multiple of 5, write "Buzz".
    - If a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, write "FizzBuzz".
  * Solution #1: use 'while' loop
  * Solution #2: use 'for' and 'foreach' loops with an array
* Task #2:
  * Avoid printing anything when a number is divisible by 3 ("Fizz").
  * Use 'continue' to skip desired numbers
* Task #2:
  * Stop printing values after the first "FizzBuzz".
  * Use 'break' to stop iteration



Example output:
```
Task #3: 
Stop printing values after the first "FizzBuzz".
