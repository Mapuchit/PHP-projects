# PHP Number Guesser - PHP conditionals and logic
> A game where the user can guess a number and get feedback on how many times they guessed right.

## General info
The program runs in the command line. It practices PHP conditionals and logic. 


## Technologies
* PHP v8.0.0
* Git v2.24.1.windows.2


## Features
* Play 10 rounds - 10 guesses.
* Use global variables to keep track of rounds and score.
* Prompt the user to guess a number between 1 and 10.
* Check if the guess is valid (not in the range or not a number).
  * If guess is invalid, use a while loop to keep asking for a new guess.
* Print feedback about the players guessing ability at the end of 10 rounds.
  * Show percentage of correct guesses.
  * Let the player know if they tended to guess high or low.


Example output:
```
After 10 rounds, here are some facts about your guessing:
You guessed the number correctly 20% of the time.
When you guessed wrong, you tended to guess high.
